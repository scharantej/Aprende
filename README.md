 1. In the previous runs, I received feedback that I needed to improve the overall structure of my websites. I plan to do this by using a more consistent layout and by making sure that all of the elements on my pages are properly aligned.

2. I also received feedback that I needed to ensure that I am not generating code corresponding to SQLite in my Flask applications. I plan to do this by using a different database engine, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

3. Finally, I received feedback that I needed to ensure that my HTML files are properly formatted with the correct connections to the backend database. I plan to do this by using a more consistent coding style and by making sure that all of my HTML files are properly linked to the correct routes in my Flask application.

For the problem of building a learning plan for teaching Spanish, I plan to create a Flask application that includes the following HTML files:

* A home page that provides an overview of the application and the different features that it offers.
* A login page that allows users to create an account and log in to the application.
* A dashboard page that provides users with access to the different features of the application, such as creating and managing learning plans, tracking their progress, and accessing resources.
* A learning plans page that allows users to create and manage their learning plans.
* A progress tracking page that allows users to track their progress towards their learning goals.
* A resources page that provides users with access to resources that can help them learn Spanish, such as articles, videos, and audio files.

I also plan to create the following routes in my Flask application:

* A home route that renders the home page.
* A login route that handles user login requests.
* A dashboard route that renders the dashboard page.
* A learning plans route that renders the learning plans page.
* A progress tracking route that renders the progress tracking page.
* A resources route that renders the resources page.
